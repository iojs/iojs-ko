* How you will feel after you submit your first PR.
-->
* 처음 PR을 제출한 후 기분이 어떨까요.

<!--
It’s 2017 and one of your New Year’s resolutions is contributing back to the Node.js project. So, where do you get started?
-->
당신의 2017년에 새해 결심 중 하나가 Node.js 프로젝트에 다시 기여하기 입니다. 그럼 어디서 시작해야 할까요?

<!--
Rich Trott, a Node.js Core Technical Committee member, talked a bit about contributing to Node.js Core in this Node.js Interactive North America video, but there were still a ton of questions after his talk.
-->
Node.js 핵심 기술위원회 멤버인 Rich Trott는이 Node.js Interactive North America 비디오에서 Node.js Core에 기여하는 것에 대해 이야기했지만, 이야기가 끝난 후에도 여전히 많은 질문이 있었습니다.

<!--
He decided to host a Sideway conversation with Node.js collaborators, Anna Henningsen and Bryan English to help answer additional questions from those that are looking to participate in the Node.js Project.
-->
그는 Node.js 공동 작업자인 Anna Henningsen과 Bryan English와 Sideway 대화를 주최하기로 결정하여 Node.js 프로젝트에 참여하고자하는 사람들로부터 추가 질문에 답할 수 있도록 했습니다.

<!--
Below is a condensed version of the conversation. Do you have more questions on this topic? Please ask Anna, Bryan or Rich on Twitter or GitHub.
-->
아래 대화의 요약 버전입니다. 이 주제에 대해 더 궁금한 점이 있습니까? 트위터 또는 GitHub에서 Anna, Bryan 또는 Rich에게 문의하세요.

<!--
### Why is it important to contribute to Node.js?
-->
### Node.js에 기여하는 것이 중요한 이유는 무엇입니까?

<!--
Rich: Helping folks contribute to Node.js Core is important to me for at least two reasons:
-->
Rich : Node.js Core에 기여하는 사람들을 돕는 것이 적어도 두 가지 이유에서 중요합니다.

<!--
- First, it contributes to the health of the project. If it’s easy for people with talents to use those talents to help the project, then the project benefits.
-->
- 첫째, 프로젝트의 건강에 기여합니다. 재능을 가진 사람들이 재능을 사용하여 프로젝트를 도울 수 있다면 프로젝트에게 이익입니다.

<!--
- Second, it’s a moral imperative (in my opinion). Being energetic in the pursuit of contributors hopefully means we’re not being exclusionary, or at least being less exclusionary than we’d be if we weren’t trying to help new and existing contributors.
-->
- 둘째로, 그것은 도덕적인 명령입니다(사견으로는). 기여를 추구하는 데 열정을 가지고 있다면, 우리가 새로운 기존 기여자를 도우려하지 않는다면 우리가 배타적이지 않고 적어도 배타적이지 않다는 것을 의미합니다.
<!--이부분에 대한 해석이 어렵네요. 도움을 부탁드립니다.-->

<!--
Bryan: I’d add that it’s important to me that people treat the project as part of their application, and not just as a upstream chunk of code written by “other” people. Getting more people contributing is a big part of that.
-->
Bryan : 저는 사람들이 프로젝트를 "다른"사람들이 작성한 코드의 업스트림 덩어리가 아니라 응용 프로그램의 일부로 취급하는 것이 중요하다고 저에게 덧붙였습니다. 더 많은 사람들을 기여하게하는 것은 그것의 중요한 부분입니다.

<!--
Anna: That’s a perfect addition, yes — It’s a problem that Node.js Core has been having in the past and imho this is an important way of working on it!
-->
Anna : 완벽한 추가입니다. Node.js Core가 과거와 현재 가지고 있었던 문제입니다. 이 작업의 중요한 방법입니다!

<!--
### Question: How can someone who isn’t a strong developer contribute back to Node.js Core?
-->
### 질문: 대단한 개발자가 아닌 개발자가 Node.js Core에 어떻게 기여할 수 있습니까?

<!--
Rich: I think there’s two ways to answer that question: One if we’re talking about someone who is essentially not a developer and not particularly interested in being a developer. And the other answer would be for people who are developers, just not very experienced.
-->
Rich : 저는 그 질문에 두 가지 방법이 있다고 생각합니다. 하나는 개발자가 아니며 개발자가 되는 데 관심이없는 사람에 대한 이야기입니다. 그리고 다른 대답은 경험이 별로없는 개발자들에게 달려 있습니다.

<!--
Anna: So, if you’re not a developer: You can always try to look at the documentation side of things, watch out for typos and passages that seem unclear to you (especially if you’re not a developer or not a particularly experienced one!)
-->
Anna : 개발자가 아닌 경우 항상 설명서의 주변을 살펴보고, 개발자에게 알 수 없는 오타 및 구절을 주의해야합니다.(특히 개발자가 아니거나 경험이없는 개발자의 경우)

<!--
William Kapke gave a [great talk at Node Interactive in Austin, TX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV0p3ET1vpU) on how he contributes (invaluably!) to the Node project without writing any code in Node.js Core itself — if you have the time, it’s worth listening to.
-->
William Kapke는 Node.js Core 자체에 코드를 작성하지 않고 Node 프로젝트에 기여하는 방법에 대해 이야기합니다.[great talk at Node Interactive in Austin, TX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV0p3ET1vpU) - 시간이 있다면 들을 만한 가치가 있습니다.

<!--
Rich: If your English is strong, there are a bunch of things that we could use help with in the docs: there is way too much abuse of hyphens; there are tons of comma splices; overuse of passive voice; tons of stuff that is too wordy and needs to be edited down… And of course, doc omissions and errors. Please fix those.
-->
Rich: 당신이 영어를 잘한다면, 문서에서 도움을 받을 수 있는 여러 가지가 있습니다. 하이픈의 너무 많은 남용용; 많은 쉼표와 이어쓰기; 수동적인 목소리의 남용; 너무 장황하고 편집할 필요가 있는 수 많은 것들... 이러한 문서 누락과 오류를 고쳐주세요.

<!--
If you are strong in a language other than English, translation help is always needed/welcome. (Unfortunately, non-English docs are in separate repositories on a per-language basis, I believe.)
-->
영어가 아닌 다른 언어에 강하다면, 번역 작업은 도움이 항상 필요하며 환영합니다. (불행하게도, 영어 이외의 문서는, 각 언어를 기반으로 별도의 저장소에 있습니다.)

<!--
Anna: If you are eager to get going on this, the source files for the docs are at https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/doc
-->
Anna: 이 작업에 열심인 경우 문서의 소스 파일은 다음 위치에 있습니다. https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/doc

<!--
Rich: I would also add that I consider just opening issues for bugs you find to be a form of contributing to Node.js Core. A good bug report (emphasis on good) is incredibly valuable.
-->
Rich: 저는 또한 여러분이 Node.js Core에 기여하는 형태로 발견한 버그에 대한 이슈를 추가할 것 입니다. 좋은 버그 리포트 (좋은에 강조)는 믿을 수 없을 정도로 가치가 있습니다.

<!--
On the other question of how to contribute code if you’re not very experienced, I try to set people up with code cleanup on tests. That’s my go-to for first-time contributors. It’s a good thing to start with, whether you are experienced or not, because it’s a good idea to focus on the process the first time you contribute anyway, rather than focusing on how the code works.
-->
경험이 별로 없다면 코드를 제공하는 방법에 대한 다른 질문에서 테스트에서 코드 정리를 사용하여 사람들을 설정하려고합니다. 그것은 처음으로 기여한 사람들을 위한 것입니다. 경험이 있건 없건 간에 처음부터 시작하는 것은 좋은 일입니다. 왜냐하면 코드가 어떻게 작동하는지에 초점을 맞추는 것이 아니라 처음 기여할 때 프로세스에 집중하는 것이 바람직하기 때문입니다.

<!--
Tests are usually understandable, and even when they’re not, you can still feel pretty secure changing some instances of var to const and updating a few assert.equal() instances to assert.strictEqual().
-->
테스트는 대개 이해할 수 있으며, 그렇지 않은 경우에도 const의 일부 인스턴스를 const로 변경하고 assert.strictEqual()에 몇 개의 assert.equal() 인스턴스를 업데이트 하는 것이 매우 안전하다고 느낄 수 있습니다.

<!--
I have a Twitter handle (@NodeTodo) and an email address (help@[nodetodo.org](https://sidewayembed.com/redirect?url=unknown%3A%2F%2Fnodetodo.org)) that anyone who has never contributed to Node.js can use to request a simple first commit.
-->
Node.js에 기여한 적이 없는 사람이라면 간단한 첫 번째 커밋을 요청할 수있는 Twitter 핸들 (@NodeTodo)과 전자 메일 주소 (help@[nodetodo.org](https://sidewayembed.com/redirect?url=unknown%3A%2F%2Fnodetodo.org))가 있습니다.

<!--
Anna: So one thing: Don’t worry! Node.js is a large software project, so it’s kind of intimidating by default. But it’s not realistic that you’d actually have to worry about breaking something by accident or something like that — we have a lot of mechanisms in place to prevent that, and we’re always quite happy to see first-time contributors step up to the challenge! :)
-->
Anna: 그래서 한 가지: 걱정 마세요! Node.js는 대규모 소프트웨어 프로젝트이기 때문에 기본적으로 위협적입니다. 그러나 실수로 무언가를 깨뜨리는 것에 대해 걱정해야 한다는 것은 현실적이지 않습니다. 우리는 그러한 사고를 막기위한 많은 메커니즘을 가지고 있습니다. 우리는 처음으로 기여자들이 도전에 나서는 것에 대해 항상 행복하게 생각합니다! :)

<!--
Bryan: Many of my contributions (including my first) have been out of needs I had in my day-to-day work, so I’d encourage when submitting a bug report (a good one, as Rich mentioned), to think about ways it could become your first PR.
-->
Bryan: 저의 첫 번째 기여를 비롯한 많은 기여는 저의 일상 업무에서 필요로 하는 것이 아니므로, 버그 보고서(Rich가 언급한 좋은 내용)를 제출할 때, 처음 PR이 될 수있는 방법.

<!--
Anna: Right — if you feel like you’re up for doing it, you can try to compile Node.js from the git repository and make install, so it becomes your default node binary, and update that from time to time. That’s basically how I got started finding bugs in Node.js.
-->
Anna: 맞아요. 당신이 일을 하고 있는 것처럼 느껴진다면 git 저장소에서 Node.js를 컴파일하고 설치하여 기본 노드 바이너리가 되고 때때로 업데이트 할 수 있습니다. 이것이 기본적으로 Node.js에서 버그를 찾기 시작하는 방법입니다.

<!--
Rich: Just make sure you do that only in an environment that can handle occasional breakage. :-D
-->
Rich: 중단을 처리 할 수 있는 환경에서만 그렇게해야합니다. :-D

<!--
Anna: right. ;) If you do encounter any bugs — don’t feel obliged to fix them yourself if it seems overwhelming, like Rich said, a good bug report is worth gold.
-->
Anna: 맞습니다. ;) 버그가 발생하는 경우 - 감당하지 못할 것으로 보일 경우 직접 수정해야 한다고 생각하지 마세요. Rich가 말했듯이, 좋은 버그 리포트는 금의 가치가 있습니다.

<!--
### Question: What would be the next level after code cleanups at the test subsystem?
-->
### 질문: 테스트 하위 시스템에서 코드 정리 후 다음 단계는 무엇입니까?

<!--
Rich: Good question from someone who has been doing a ton of test cleanup. :-D
-->
Rich: 테스트 정리를 해본 적이있는 사람이 본 좋은 질문입니다. :-D

<!--
Anna (with some contributions from others as well) set up [coverage.nodejs.org](https://sidewayembed.com/redirect?url=unknown%3A%2F%2Fcoverage.nodejs.org). I often tell people to look at the test coverage to find a good second commit after they’ve landed their first commit. That will get you out of cleaning up existing tests and into writing new tests.
There’s a guide in the source tree (under doc/guides/[writing-tests.md](https://sidewayembed.com/redirect?url=unknown%3A%2F%2Fwriting-tests.md)) that goes over how to write a test for Node.js core.
-->

<!--
If you’re into C++, then I’d say ask one of the C++ people like Anna.
-->

<!--
Anna: One thing, in a similar vein, maybe even one or steps further down the road: Our benchmarks are far from complete, too. Feel free to look around in that folder and see if something strikes you as missing!
-->

<!--
Bryan: Even with good coverage, some code paths can be missed, so it’s sometimes worth it to look at a test file and see if it’s missing anything.
-->

<!--
Rich: I should also mention that I have a definite bias towards tests. I don’t think tests were my first contribution to Node.js, but they definitely are where I have spent the most time, overwhelmingly. Asking someone else might get a different answer. One place you can always ask is #node-dev on Freenode IRC. That’s for Node.js Core discussions. General Node.js questions should go to #Node.js instead.
-->

<!--
### Question: I have contributed once on a simple issue. Will @NodeTodo keep me in the loop on newer simpler issues?
-->

<!--
Rich: I try not to hand out specific second commits via NodeTodo too much. I try to direct people to coverage.nodejs.org or otherwise have them come up with their own issues. I try to keep stuff in reserve for first-timers. I’m not sure I have a good concrete reason for that. It just feels right, I guess. But I’m happy to help anyone figure out a second (or third or fourth) commit. It will just take longer and be more effort.
-->

<!--
### Question: Is the roadmap for Node well-defined? Do you accept feature requests from the community or do most of the ideas come from the core group?
-->

<!--
Anna: We don’t have a fixed, centralized roadmap, and we definitely want to talk about feature requests from and with the community; but keep in mind that a lot of people would prefer to have those things in Node core that can’t be easily implemented and maintained in userland (= outside of Node core, for example as an npm package).
-->

<!--
Rich: You shouldn’t feel shy about opening an issue and asking, though.

Yeah, there’s a feature request label on the issue tracker, so feature requests are welcome.

Also, if you have a concrete idea, implementation design and all, take a look at https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps.
-->

<!--
Anna: That node-eps is for the really large and wide-reaching changes — I wouldn’t recommend going there first, actually. If you want to see a feature implemented, go to nodejs/node, and we’ll see where to go from there :)
-->

<!--
Rich: Yes, node-eps repo is definitely not the first stop.
-->

<!--
### Question: How much of the core effort is C++ vs JS?
-->
### 질문: 얼마나 많은 핵심 노력이 들어갔나요? C++ vs JS

<!--
Anna: I’m pretty sure the overwhelming majority of code in Node core is written in JS, and you definitely do not need any C++ knowledge to contribute to Node! The same goes the other way around: You probably don’t actually need to know JS for contributing to the C++ side of things.
-->

<!--
That being said, there’s much more activity around the JS parts of Node, and a lot more people are involved on that side.
-->

<!--
Bryan: Most of the C++ code I’ve seen in core is glue code, providing things from libraries like LibUV and OpenSSL to JavaScript. So yeah, a majority of what’s actually happening in core seems to be in JavaScript-land.
-->

<!--
### Question: I’m just starting with PR’s to bigger public node based projects. I’ve done a number of small PR’s, I’m working on a PR for ‘got’ currently but would also definitely like to contribute to node core in the future. A question I struggled with slightly is that a PR can be a lot of work. Especially when submitting something that isn’t ‘your first PR’. For a younger developer, this can be intimidating because of the fear your PR gets outright rejected. Fixing a comparison is one thing, but many issues require more than a couple lines. Would you encourage us young ones to power on and accept sometimes you will lose time with little return, submitting code that’s subpar? Or alternatively encourage discussion on the issue and perhaps prematurely opening a PR to get some direction and work on with confidence?
-->

<!--
Rich: There are two approaches that I can think of offhand:
-->

<!--
- One is to hop on IRC (or Slack or whatever) and chat with devs on the project. Obviously that will only work if the project in question has devs available that way and if the right people are available when you come to ask questions. So, that can be a bit of toss of the dice.
- Another approach (which you touch on) is issue tracker based. Of course, comments and back-and-forth and “here’s a little bit of code, does this look like the right approach” can help.
-->

<!--
So you can just opening a PR if you can put together some minimal approach that won’t take you three weeks of work just to have it rejected.
-->

<!--
If you can get philosophical about it and decide that the goal is to learn and improve yourself and the world, a rejected PR is not a failure. It’s a journey. A learning process. But it’s easier to type that than to internalize that attitude, I suspect.
-->

<!--
Another thing is that the whole “oh my gosh, I can’t possibly submit a PR because all those smart people will make fun of me”… I mean, you didn’t say that, but I’m taking it to an extreme, perhaps… If that’s the attitude the project is projecting, then we’ve got a lot of work to do.
-->

<!--
If that’s just sorta how one might feel about any large project, we still have work to do. Because we need to be a project that feels welcoming.

I’m wall-of-texting and drifting away from the actual question. Go, Bryan!
-->

<!--
Bryan: Well I was just going to say I get that feeling with nearly every PR I submit, or at least some form of it. It’s nobody’s fault, it’s just being nervous about putting stuff you’ve created out for public review. It can be nerve-wracking.
-->

<!--
The fear of rejection is real, but I think pushing through it eventually makes you a better developer, by taking any commentary that comes and using it to make your PR (or your next one) better.

Also, (and this was hard for me early on) never take criticism of your PR as a personal attack.
-->

<!--
Anna: Oh, just to be clear: If the criticism of your PR is not based on its technical merits, and it is a personal attack, report that to one of us and we’ll take care of it (or any member of the core team you trust a bit).
-->

<!--
### Question: What’s the difference between Code & Learn, Node Todo, NodeSchool…?
-->

<!--
Rich: Code & Learn started as an effort to try to teach new people about corners of the code where we have inadequate number of people who understand it. It has morphed into helping people become contributors. First-time contributors, mostly, although it’s still a great event if you want to get deeper in the code because there will always be core devs there, often ones who have knowledge about the code base few others do.
-->

<!--
Node Todo is all about the first-time contributor. The main differences (from my perspective) between Code & Learn and Node Todo are:
- Code & Learn is a project of the Node.js Foundation while Node Todo is something anyone can do.
- There are no sponsors and Node Todo is always free and open to the public.
- The other thing about Node Todo is that it’s not just an event. You can just email or use Twitter to get going.
-->

<!--
NodeSchool is also a community effort, but has nothing to do with getting started with Node.js core and contributing. It’s all about learning about Node.js and adjacent technologies, not about the core code in the project.
-->

<!--
### Question: What’s the easiest way I can find things that I could possibly contribute to Node Core?
-->

<!--
Rich: My incredibly brief answer to the easiest way to find things you could possibly contribute to Node core is: http://nodetodo.org/getting-started/
-->

<!--
But that interprets the question with emphasis on the “easiest” part. I suspect Tierney may have intended the emphasis to be on “possibly”. That is, instead of “how do I find something, anything, easily”, it may have been “how can I find all the things where contributing is possible”.
-->

<!--
Getting started contributing to Node.js. My answer there might be: [Ask William Kapke](https://twitter.com/williamkapke). :-D
-->

<!--
There’s a [Getting Involved](https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/) section on the website and a list of all the [working groups](https://nodejs.org/en/about/working-groups/) that’s a good place to get started.
-->

<!--
Bryan: I think using node is one of the best ways to find avenues for contribution. You’ll always find something that needs doing if you’re using node every day (for work or for fun!).
-->

<!--
### Question: Is there anything I need to know before submitting my first contribution?
-->

<!--
Rich: Hopefully, everything you need to know is here. If not, then we need to update that document, probably.
-->

<!--
Anna: Also: Read our Code of Conduct. Thanks!
-->

<!--
Rich Trott: Yeah, that’s the very first thing in that [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://sidewayembed.com/redirect?url=unknown%3A%2F%2FCONTRIBUTING.md) document. :tada:
-->

<!--
### Anything else to add before we sign off here?
-->

<!--
Anna: Yeah, I’d just like to mention that if you feel unsure about anything when contributing to or interacting with Node core, I’m always someone you can contact in private ([addaleax on Twitter](http://twitter.com/addaleax), IRC, etc.) if it helps you feel better

Rich: Ditto. :-D ([Contact for Rich](https://twitter.com/trott))

Bryan: Me three ([Contact for Bryan](https://twitter.com/bengl))
