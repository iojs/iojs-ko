<!--
We (The Node.js Foundation) held an in-person development workshop with the community at Node.js Interactive in November to accelerate work on the new Node.js Certified Developer program.
-->

<!--
The certification program aims to establish a baseline competency in Node.js. While not an expert in all areas, developers who pass the certification will be able to hit the ground running with Node.js.
-->

<!--
In the in-person development workshop, those involved in the program determined specific topics for the exam and the skills, knowledge and abilities a certified candidate should be able to demonstrate to become a Node.js Certified Developer.
-->

<!--
Currently we are working with the community to determine specific questions that will be asked on the exam. To contribute to the Node.js Foundation Certification Development Item Writing Workshop Sessions, fill out this application.

<!--
Expected to launch in Q2 this year, pricing for the self-paced, online exam is still to be determined. The exam is expected to take about 3.5 hours. The topics that will be covered on the exam will be published publically as will resources to help prepare for the certification, allowing others to leverage the source materials for their own Node.js learning.
-->

<!--
Below are more details on the goals for the certification program, work that has been done so far and how you can get involved.
-->

<!--
### Who Benefits from the Certification?
-->
### 누가 인증 혜택을 얻습니까?

<!--
This certification will be one of the biggest vendor-neutral programming language certification programs available and is designed to propel Node.js growth even further. It is intended to help:
- People who need to prove Node.js competency within a company
- Alternative programming learners eager to boost their resume for hiring or career training
- Contractors and consultants hoping to verify their Node.js skills to differentiate themselves in the market
- Identify Node.js skills that will make developers more marketable
-->

<!--
Ideal Node.js Certified Developer candidates are early intermediate-level engineers who can already work proficiently in JavaScript with the Node.js platform to build, debug, test and maintain secure framework-independent applications and CLI tools. They are capable of handling asynchronous I/O effectively and can efficiently manipulate, transform and persist various data using HTTP, files, streams, and multiple processes. They can also leverage and integrate 3rd party modules effectively.

### The Process: Debate, Consensus, Outcome
-->
### 프로세스 : 토론, 합의, 결과

<!--
Given the size and needs of Node.js users — there are currently more than 4.5 million active users per month — creating a certification for this platform and diverse community is no small feat. The process and effort in creating the Node.js Certified Developer program is something that we have taken very seriously.
-->

<!--
We worked closely with [The Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/why-certify-with-us) to create the [blueprint](https://github.com/nodejs/education/blob/master/certification.md#nodejs-certified-developer) and process for administering the program. The Linux Foundation offers a neutral home for running training and certification programs, thanks to its close involvement with the open source community. It offers several online courses and certifications, including [Kubernetes Fundamentals](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/kubernetes-fundamentals); [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfcs); [Linux Foundation Certified Engineer (LFCE)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfce); among many others.
-->

<!--
As part of its work with The Linux Foundation, we launched a working group in July to:
-->

<!--
- Define Certification(s): the number of levels, titles, program goals;
- Conduct Job Task Analysis: to define the domains of work and corresponding task within each domain a certification candidate should be able to perform.
- Define Scope Statement of Certification: Job Task Analysis workshop to determine the basic underpinnings of what a Node.js Engineer needs to know in order to be considered competent;
- Define the Exam Blueprint: containing the specific exams domains and tasks and their relevant weight within the exam.
-->

<!--
This group has had many virtual meetings and held an in-person Job Task Analysis (JTA) workshop at Node.js Interactive North America. The JTA helped the group determine the skills, knowledge and abilities a certified candidate should be able to demonstrate with the outcome of the JTA being an exam blueprint.
-->

<!--
The workshop and the progress we’ve made is only possible through the help of many individuals in the community: Tierney Coren, Ryan Lewis, Fabio Fonseca, Rajat Kumar, Charlie Robbins, Brad Farias, David Clements, Nathan White, Lawrence Grant, and Chase Moody.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for all your help!

고맙습니다! 고맙습니다! 모든 도움에 감사드립니다!

<!--
### What’s Next? Can I Help?
-->
### 향후 계획은 무엇인가요? 내가 도움이 될 수 있습니까?

<!--
The next phase of work will be finalizing the specific questions for the topics that the exam will focus on (item-writers needed!). We are looking for folks who are intermediate to advanced in their understanding of Node.js to get involved in this work. You should be experienced enough to be very comfortable with the question you are writing and know the “gotchas” involved with the domain.
-->

<!--
Each item-writer will only be able to write one question and is limited to viewing only a few questions, to maintain eligibility in receiving their own certification. The time commitment for this is a 1.5 hour intro webinar, which will review the format and how to write the question, as well as 2–5 hours​ to cover writing and reviewing the question with the Core Item Review team.
